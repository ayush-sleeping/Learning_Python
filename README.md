# Stone Paper Scissors Game made with Python 
Here I am trying to build a Basic Python Project, By writing simple basic Python code.

## What is Stone Paper Scissors Game ???

You may have played stone paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.
If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

- Stone smashes scissors.
- Paper covers stone.
- Scissors cut paper.


## Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how we are going to translate into Python code.
Here I am showing stepwise, How I have done it 
-  Need to import the module ( import random )
-  Take User Input
-  Make the Computer Choose
-  Determine a Winner
